# EDA-for-Canada-s-Inflation-Rate
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to analyze and investigate data set and summarize their main characteristics.
Time-stamped, open and structured data is used for the experiment.   
EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate. Univariate non-graphical. This is simplest form of data analysis, where the data being analyzed consists of just one variable. Since it’s a single variable, it doesn’t deal with causes or relationships. The main purpose of univariate analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that exist within it. Univariate graphical. Non-graphical methods don’t provide a full picture of the data. Graphical methods are therefore required. Common types of univariate graphics include: Stem-and-leaf plots, which show all data values and the shape of the distribution. Histograms, a bar plot in which each bar represents the frequency (count) or proportion (count/total count) of cases for a range of values. Box plots, which graphically depict the five-number summary of minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
